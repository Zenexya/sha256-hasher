### How to use
Make sure you have a website that supports PHP, or, if you want to host it on your local computer, make sure you have XAMPP (or any other local hoster) installed and running.
Put it in the htdocs, and voila.

Example for localhost usage:
http://localhost?data=yourtexttohashhere

Example for a website usage:
https://yourwebsite.com/index.php?data=yourtexttohashhere

If you want, feel free to use it on your website.
Have fun!
